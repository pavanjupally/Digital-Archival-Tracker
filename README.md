# Digital Archival Tracker #

# About the application #

A Windows desktop application using WPF for a client in Cincinnati, Ohio. Client's workflow involved reading and updating list of archived files in an excel sheet based on reports generated by Fixity software already in use by the client for determining the integrity of the archived files. Since the client had to manually open, read and close each Fixity report and update the status of files accordingly in the excel sheet, Digital Archival Tracker has streamlined the workflow. This involves Digital Archival Tracker reading and presenting individual as well as grouped Fixity report information at one place with enhanced visualization and greater accessibility. Digital Archival Tracker also incorporates the ability to read the client's current excel sheet and provide a much easier and cluster free environment for maintaining file statuses through back-end SQLite Database.
